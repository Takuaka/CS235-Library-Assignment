# COMPSCI 235 Starter Repository for Assignment 2


## Description

Just adding some notes here for the marker.

- The requirements.txt has a whole bunch of requirements added to it. I had done it when adding Flask (I think?) accidentally, and I didn't know which ones I can remove safely. I've left them all there; sorry for the inconvenience. I've separated the ones that I know I use in this project from the others.
- I did the CSS quite late; It looks good on my side, but it may look weird on a smaller screen. Sorry. 
- The last commit that will have a fully functional web_application is commited some time just after 1am on 24/09/2021. Putting this here because I'm gonna start doing the back end for a B Grade, on the off chance that doing this will break what I currently have. I will be double checking everything as I go along though, so hopefully nothing insane happens. 

## Python version

Please use Python version 3.6 or newer versions for development. Some of the depending libraries of our web application do not support Python versions below 3.6!


## Installation

**Installation via requirements.txt**

```shell
$ py -3 -m venv venv
$ venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When using PyCharm for requirements installation, set the virtual environment using 'File'->'Settings' and select your project from the left menu. Select 'Project Interpreter', click on the gearwheel button and select 'Add'. Click the 'Existing environment' radio button to select the virtual environment. 


## Testing with the pytest unit tests

After you have configured pytest as the testing tool for PyCharm (File - Settings - Tools - Python Integrated Tools - Testing), you can then run tests from within PyCharm by right-clicking the tests folder and selecting "Run pytest in tests".

Alternatively, from a terminal in the root folder of the project, you can also call 'python -m pytest tests' to run all the tests. PyCharm also provides a built-in terminal, which uses the configured virtual environment. 


## Execution of the web application

**Running the Flask application**

From the project directory, and within the activated virtual environment (see *venv\Scripts\activate* above):

````shell
$ flask run
```` 

## Data sources 

The data in the excerpt files were downloaded from (Comic & Graphic):
https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home

On this webpage, you can find more books and authors in the same file format as in our excerpt, for example for different book genres. 
These might be useful to extend your web application with more functionality.

We would like to acknowledge the authors of these papers for collecting the datasets by extracting them from Goodreads:

*Mengting Wan, Julian McAuley, "Item Recommendation on Monotonic Behavior Chains", in RecSys'18.*

*Mengting Wan, Rishabh Misra, Ndapa Nakashole, Julian McAuley, "Fine-Grained Spoiler Detection from Large-Scale Review Corpora", in ACL'19.*
